RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. The data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects which are called as tables (tutorialspoint). The table contains columns and rows. Each column contains a different type of values and each row corresponds to a single record.

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and database understands SQL.  It lets you access and manipulate database,execute queries against a database, retrieve data from database, insert records from a database,so much more.

SQL can be divided into two parts: The Data Manipulation Langauge(DML) and the Data Definition Language(DDL). 
The query and update commands form the DML part of SQL:

Select- extracts data from a database

Updates- updates data in a database

Delete- deletes data from a database

Insert into- inserts new data into a database


The DDL part of SQL permits database tables to be created or deleted.
